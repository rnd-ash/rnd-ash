## Major Projects
* [OpenVehicleDiag](https://github.com/rnd-ash/OpenVehicleDiag) - Initially my thesis project for University. Open source and cross platform car diagnostics and ECU testing platform written in Rust. Supports SocketCAN and SAE J2534 API.
* [ECU DIAG](https://github.com/rnd-ash/ecu_diagnostics) - A project based on OpenVehcileDiag to provide a Rust library that can be used for interfacing with VCI hardware for car diagnostics and implements both the KWP, UDS and OBD2 diagnostic protocol servers.
* [Ultimate-NAG52](https://github.com/rnd-ash/ultimate-nag52-fw) and [Ultimate-NAG52-Config-App](https://github.com/rnd-ash/ultimate-nag52-config-app) - A replacement Transmission controller for Mercedes' 5G-Tronic (722.6) gearbox, with full CANBUS support and supporting the CAN systems of all cars with the EGS51, EGS52 or EGS53 OEM TCUs (~1995-2012) [Project youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxrw-4Vt7xtu9d8lCkMCG0_K7oHcsSMtF)
* [Macchina-J2534](https://github.com/rnd-ash/Macchina-J2534) - A SAE J2534 (Passthru) API library for Macchina's M2 and A0 ODB2 adapters (With experimental Linux + OSX support)
* [MB-W211-PC](https://github.com/rnd-ash/mb-w211-pc) - My hobby project - Installing a full PC into the back of my W211, complete with a custom touch panel in the front, and daughter board that houses a custom amplifier and MCU. Works seamlessly with the cars CAN networks. [Project youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxrw-4Vt7xtssJNuhHKJYzeYu5KKqYpgG)
