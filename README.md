## Major Projects
* [OpenVehicleDiag](https://github.com/rnd-ash/OpenVehicleDiag) - Initially my thesis project for University. Open source and cross platform car diagnostics and ECU testing platform written in Rust. Supports SocketCAN and SAE J2534 API.
* [ECU DIAG](https://github.com/rnd-ash/ecu_diagnostics) - A project based on OpenVehcileDiag to provide a Rust library that can be used for interfacing with VCI hardware for car diagnostics and implements both the KWP, UDS and OBD2 diagnostic protocol servers.
* [Ultimate-NAG52](https://github.com/rnd-ash/ultimate_nag52) - A drop-in replacement custom Automatic transmission controller for Mercedes' 5G-Tronic (722.6) gearbox, with full CANBUS support for any Mercedes made between 2000 and 2012 with the OEM EGS52 and EGS53 modules.
* [Macchina-J2534](https://github.com/rnd-ash/Macchina-J2534) - A SAE J2534 (Passthru) API library for Macchina's M2 and A0 ODB2 adapters (With experimental Linux + OSX support)
* [MBUX-Port](https://github.com/rnd-ash/mbux-port) - An attempt to create a custom head unit application for my old 2006 Mercedes C class, based on the 2021 S class UI (MBUX), to give it more functionality - This involved reverse engineering the entire car's canbus systems. It is part of my running series on Youtube on how to create a custom headunit.
